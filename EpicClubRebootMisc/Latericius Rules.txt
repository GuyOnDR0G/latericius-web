Welcome to the Latericius Commnuity! Like any server, we have a nice set of rules here to follow, and if you follow them we assure you'll have a great time!

**1.** Above all else, follow the Discord ToS at ALL TIMES! Failure to do so will result in punishment.

**2.** Chat spam is not permitted - chat spam is considered five lines of the same message within a few minutes - this is mutable.

**3.** No NSFW whatsoever, meaning porn, gore, or anything else 18+. **Continuation of rule #1, NOTHING illegal is permitted, at all. NO exceptions.**

**4.** **No pinging staff if it isn’t urgent/emergency related.**

**5.** No advertisement is permitted in this server - we are not here to supply you an audience!

**6.** Toxicity/Drama will NOT be tolerated in any form. This means no starting arguments/playing along with them, bandwagoning, or being generically rude. Furthermore, do not bring drama from other servers/places here! Alongside this, if you witness drama, do not DM people/message here demanding to know what is going on - feeding into drama AT ALL won't be tolerated. This rule is fervently emphasized.

**7.** Do not post any files that are not of formats .mp3 .mp4 .ogg .rbxl .rbxm .txt .wav .wmv without asking a staff first! Any other files that are not music/video/image files are not permitted (such as .exe and .Ink files).

**8.** Do not attempt to leave and rejoin/make alts in the server to evade bans/warnings - this is an instant ban.

**9.** The posting of people's personal information against their will is STRICTLY prohibited - this will result in an instant termination.

**10.** Searching for/abusing loopholes is not tolerated at all.

**11.** No racial/sexual slurs are tolerated either, this will not be treated lightly. Harassment is strictly prohibited. IT DOESN’T MATTER WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE.

**12.** Begging for a role or position frequently will result in consequences.

**13.** No epileptic content (gifs, video, imagery, etcetera). Doing so will result in a mute and further consequences from there.

**14.** Do not use expletives in demeaning, condescending or rude ways, and also don't use it in excess.

If you're unsure of a rule, USE COMMON SENSE. We respect decency.
The rules listed above are subject to change - we will notify you all when this occurs.

We hope you have a good time in the Latericius Community server!
